Code Review and Documentation:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) violation:
The Report class is responsible for both generating reports and determining how to format the reports based on the employee's role. 
This violates SRP because a class should have only one reason to change, but this class has multiple responsibilities (generating reports and formatting them).
Rationale: If the formatting requirements change or if there are additional report types, it would require modifications to this class, increasing its complexity and making it more error-prone.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP) violation:
The Report class is not closed for modification and open for extension. If a new role is introduced (e.g., "Quality Assurance"), the generate_report method needs to be modified to accommodate this new role.
Rationale: This violates OCP because the class should be open for extension (new roles) but closed for modification (existing code shouldn't need to change).

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) violation:
Manager and Developer inherit from Employee, but the BonusCalculator relies on specific role checks (if employee.role == "Manager"). This means that Manager and Developer are not substitutable for Employee in the context of BonusCalculator.
Rationale: LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. Here, substituting Employee with Manager or Developer in BonusCalculator could lead to unexpected behavior.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) violation:
There's no explicit interface, but conceptually, Report and BonusCalculator might force clients to depend on methods they don't use. For instance, a client interested in generating reports might need to depend on bonus calculation methods from BonusCalculator.
Rationale: ISP suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Breaking down interfaces into smaller, specific ones can prevent this.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) violation:
Report and BonusCalculator both directly depend on concrete implementations (Manager and Developer). This makes them tightly coupled to specific implementations rather than abstractions.
Rationale: DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions. Here, both Report and BonusCalculator should depend on an abstraction (like an interface) rather than concrete implementations.

Refactoring Plan:

SRP Refactoring:
1. Separate the responsibilities of generating reports and formatting them into different classes.
Introduce an interface for report generation to allow for different report formats.

OCP Refactoring:
Implement a strategy pattern for report generation to allow for easy extension when new roles are introduced.

LSP Refactoring:
Refactor BonusCalculator to use polymorphism instead of role checks to calculate bonuses.

ISP Refactoring:
basedreak down Report and BonusCalculator into smaller, more specific interfaces to avoid forcing clients to depend on methods they don't use.

DIP Refactoring:
Introduce abstractions (interfaces) for Manager and Developer to decouple Report and BonusCalculator from concrete implementations.
